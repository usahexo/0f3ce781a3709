The objective of the game is to have a hand with a higher total value than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. Players are dealt two cards, and they can choose to "hit" (receive another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).

In Greece, blackjack is often played with six or eight decks of cards, and the dealer must stand on a soft 17. The payout for a blackjack is usually 3:2, and players can also make additional side bets, such as betting on whether the dealer will bust or not.
