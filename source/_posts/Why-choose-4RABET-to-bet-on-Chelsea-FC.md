#  Are there any other bookmakers that offer better odds when betting on Chelsea FC matches?

Chelsea FC is one of the most successful clubs in English football. The Blues have won numerous trophies over the years, including five Premier League titles and a Champions League crown.

Despite their impressive record, Chelsea are not always favourites to win matches. This means that there is potential for betting on them to bring in good returns. However, not all bookmakers offer the same odds when betting on Chelsea games.

So, are there any other bookmakers that offer better odds when betting on Chelsea FC matches? In this article, we will take a look at three different bookmakers and compare the odds they offer for a variety of different bets on Chelsea games.

# Bet365

Bet365 is one of the most popular online bookmakers in the world. The company offers a wide range of betting markets for sports events, including football matches.

When it comes to betting on Chelsea games, Bet365 offers some competitive odds. For example, the company currently offers odds of 11/4 for Chelsea to win the Premier League title this season. They also offer 2/1 for the Blues to reach the Champions League final this year.

In terms of specific bets, Bet365 offers 5/2 for Diego Costa to score first in any match and 5/4 for Eden Hazard to score first in any match. These are some good odds and could lead to some profitable bets if placed correctly.

# 888Sport

888Sport is another leading online bookmaker which offers bettors a wide range of betting markets, including those for football matches. When it comes to Chelsea games, 888Sport offers slightly different odds from Bet365. For example, they offer 7/2 for Chelsea to win the Premier League title this season and 3/1 for them to reach the Champions League final this year.

In terms of specific bets, 888Sport offers 13/8 for Diego Costa to score first in any match and 9/4 for Eden Hazard to score first in any match. These are still good odds but may not be as favourable as those offered by Bet365.
