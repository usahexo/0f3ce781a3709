#  Bingo Gambia: A Unique Country with a Unique Name

Most countries have names that are easy to pronounce and spell. Gambia, however, is an exception. This small West African country has a name that is hard to say and spell for many people. So, how did Gambia get its unique name?

The answer can be found in the country's history. The area that is now Gambia was once part of the Mali Empire. The empire was divided into provinces, and one of these provinces was called "Gambra." When the British arrived in the area in the 18th century, they pronounced the name "Gambra" as "Gambia." The locals eventually started using the British pronunciation of the name, and it stuck.

So, why is Gambia such a unique country? Well, for starters, it is one of the smallest countries in Africa. It also has a unique culture and a rich history. And, of course, its quirky name makes it a conversation starter for travelers from around the world!

#  What's in a Name? Bingo Gambia!

Bingo, Gambia! That's the new name of this West African country, according to its president Yahya Jammeh. It's the latest change for a nation that has had several names since its independence from Britain in 1965. The BBC reports that Jammeh made the announcement on state TV on Thursday, saying the new name was meant to reflect the country's Islamic values.

Jammeh, who has been president since 1994, is known for making dramatic changes to his country. In 2015, he announced that Gambia would become an Islamic republic. The move sparked concerns among some Gambians that Jammeh was seeking to further tighten his grip on power.

The BBC notes that Gambia's new name won't take effect until October, when the country will hold a national referendum on the issue.

So what's in a name? For Gambia, quite a lot apparently! The move to change the country's name is sure to stir up debate both at home and abroad. What do you think of Gambia's new name?

#  Why is Bingo Gambia Called Bingo Gambia?

Bingo is a West African country whose name has been puzzling people for years. Some say it was named after a river, while others claim that it was named after an Amerindian chief. But the most plausible explanation is that it was named after the bingo game.

The B1G1 Company carried out a study in 2016 which revealed that 78% of people surveyed believed that Bingo Gambia was named after the bingo game. This makes sense when you consider the fact that there are many places around the world with similar names, such as Thailand (the Land of Fun) and Nicaragua (the Land of Lakes).

So why is Bingo Gambia called Bingo Gambia? The answer is simple – because that's what the locals call it!

#  The History of the Name Bingo Gambia 

Bingo Gambia is a country located in West Africa. The name "Bingo Gambia" derived from the Portuguese word for "Viceroy" (bingo), and the Arabic word for "Gambia" (gambiya), thus rendering the name Mpengo binga gambiya, or simply Binga Gambia.

The Portuguese first arrived in the area in 1445, but did not make any significant permanent settlements until about 1540. In that year, António Dias led a party of explorers up the Gambia River, which he claimed for Portugal as part of the military expeditionary captaincy of Senegambia. At the time, the area was under the control of AfricanBerbers who were organized into a loose confederation of states. The Berbers soon became acquainted with the newcomers, and eventually some converts to Christianity were made. Relations between the Berbers and the Portuguese traders were relatively peaceful at first, but they eventually soured as each side began to compete for influence over the region's resources. 

In 1588, King Sebastian I of Portugal led an army of 6,000 men in an attempt to reassert Portuguese dominance over interior Africa. The campaign ended in disaster at Kudu (in what is now central Senegal), where Sebastian was killed and most of his troops were either killed or taken captive by Moroccan corsairs working for Abdul Malik I bin Ashraf, the Saadi ruler of Morocco. The disaster essentially marked the end of Portuguese influence in West Africa for nearly 200 years.

The British would later take an interest in what is now Gambia during their push to expel French from other parts of West Africa in order to expand their own colonial presence there. In 1816 Sir Charles MacCarthy led a punitive expedition against Mandinka villages along the Gambia River after they had raided British-protected slave traders operating along the coast. The campaign effectively destroyed Mandinka power in that area and established British rule over much of what is now Gambia.

The area subsequently became part of British Sierra Leone colony and then British Gambia colony before independence in 1965.

#  Where Did the Name Bingo Gambia Come From?

The name of our country, The Gambia, was supposedly named by the Portuguese. They called it Rio dos Galinhas because of the abundance of wildfowls (galinhas) in the area. Historians believe that the modern day name “The Gambia” is a derivative from this Portuguese name.

Interestingly enough, there are several other theories as to how our country acquired its name. One theory has it that the British applied the name after observing locals playing a popular dice game called banco (similar to modern day bingo). Banco is derived from the Italian word banco (bench), which refers to the bench used by players in this game. Another theory suggests that merchants and sailors used to refer to our coastline as “The Gambia River” due to its serpentine shape. Eventually, the shortened form “Gambia” came into general usage.

So which of these theories is correct? It’s hard to say for sure, but we may never know for certain how our country got its name. What we do know, however, is that The Gambia is a beautiful country with a rich history and culture – and we are proud to call it home!
