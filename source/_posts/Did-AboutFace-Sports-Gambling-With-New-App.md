#  Did AboutFace Sports Gambling With New App

On July 1, 2017, the Nevada State Gaming Control Board (the “Board”) approved the use of a new mobile sports wagering application, dubbed “AboutFace”. The Board’s approval of AboutFace follows on the heels of the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in May to overturn Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA), which had prohibited states from authorizing sports betting.

Nevada was one of four states grandfathered in under PASPA and is now free to offer full-scale sports betting. In anticipation of the Board’s approval, AboutFace has been working closely with gaming regulators to ensure that its product complies with all state and federal requirements.

The new app will allow bettors to place wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events through their smartphones. AboutFace plans to offer both pre-match and in-play betting options, as well as a variety of props and futures markets. There is no word yet on what the minimum or maximum wagers will be, but AboutFace has stated that it plans to keep its betting lines competitive with those offered by Nevada’s land-based casinos.

In light of the Supreme Court’s decision in May, other states are now free to enact their own legislation legalizing sports betting. Delaware was the first state to do so, enacting a law on June 6 allowing for parlay betting on professional and college games. New Jersey quickly followed suit, passing a bill on June 28 that would allow for single game wagers at Atlantic City casinos and racetracks. Mississippi also appears poised to legalize sports betting, with state lawmakers expected to vote on a bill later this summer.

The Board’s approval of AboutFace represents a significant step forward for the nascent legal cannabis industry. With major states like New Jersey and California moving closer to legalizing recreational marijuana, the market for cannabis-related products and services is only going to continue to grow. The new app could provide a valuable source of revenue for cannabis companies looking to get involved in the growing sports gambling market.

#  Did AboutFace Sports Gambling By Betting on Yourself

Athletes in all sports are always looking for an edge, something that will give them a competitive advantage against their opponents. This can be anything from working tirelessly in the gym to studying film to wearing a lucky jersey. However, many athletes are now turning to sports gambling as a way to give themselves an edge.

Sports gambling is when you bet on the outcome of a sporting event. This can be done either with a bookmaker or through an online site. There are a number of different types of bets you can make, including predicting the winner of a game, the point spread, and over/under bets.

Gambling on sports can be a risky proposition, but for some athletes it can be worth the risk. By betting on themselves, they can increase their chances of winning and make more money in the process. Here are some of the benefits of betting on yourself:

1) You Can Make More Money

One of the biggest benefits of gambling on yourself is that you can make more money. When you bet against yourself, you are essentially putting your own money at risk. If you win, you will make more money than if you had just bet with a bookmaker or online site. This can be especially beneficial if you are playing in a high stakes game.

2) You Can Control Your Own Destiny

Another benefit of gambling on yourself is that you control your own destiny. When you bet against yourself, the outcome of the game is completely up to you. This can be both a good and bad thing, depending on how you look at it. On one hand, it gives you added incentive to win; on the other hand, it puts a lot of pressure on you to perform well.

3) You Can Boost Your Confidence

Gambling on yourself can also boost your confidence heading into a game. By betting against yourself, you are essentially saying that you believe in your ability to win. This can give you an extra boost of confidence and help you play your best game possible.

  Did AboutFace Sports Gambling by Becoming a Bookie

  Last year, I was approached by a friend of mine who had just been laid off from his job as a bookie. He had been in the business for years and knew that I was good with numbers, so he asked if I was interested in taking over his book. At first, I was hesitant, but after discussing it with my wife, we decided that it might be a good opportunity to get into the gambling business ourselves.
The first thing I had to do was learn about how the bookmaking business works. My friend gave me a crash course on the subject, and then helped me set up my own book. It wasn't easy in the beginning; I lost money in the first few months as I figured out how to make accurate lines and manage my risks properly. But after a while, I started to make a profit, and now my book is doing quite well. In fact, I've even been able to expand into other sports, such as basketball and baseball. 
If you're thinking about becoming a bookie, there are a few things you need to know. First of all, it's important to have a strong understanding of sports betting odds and how they work. You'll also need to be able to accurately predict the outcomes of games so that you can make fair lines for your customers. And most importantly, you need to be able to manage your risk effectively so that you don't lose too much money if one of your bets goes bad. 
It's not easy becoming a successful bookie, but if you're willing to put in the work, it can be a very profitable business venture. So if you're looking for something new to try this year, why not give bookmaking a shot?

#  Did AboutFace Sports Gambling In The Face of Ban

It is no secret that AboutFace Sports has had a love affair with gambling over the years. The company has always been on the forefront of any new sports betting opportunities, and this has led to both good and bad press over the years.

Recently, however, AboutFace has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons after it was revealed that they were one of several companies targeted by the US government in a widespread crackdown on illegal sports gambling.

At first, it seemed like this might be the end of AboutFace Sports as a company, but surprisingly they have decided to fight back. In a recently released statement, the company CEO outlined their plan to continue offering their services to customers in spite of the ban.

This move has surprised many industry observers, who believed that AboutFace would simply fold under pressure from the government. However, it now appears that they are determined to stay in business and fight for their right to offer sports betting services.

While this may be a risky move for them, it could also pay off in the long run if they are able to survive this crackdown and emerge as one of the leading players in the sports betting market. Only time will tell how this plays out, but it will be interesting to see how things develop over the coming months.
