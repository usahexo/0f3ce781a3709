#  Israeli powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv storms through to semifinal of poker tournament

One of the most successful teams in European basketball, Maccabi Tel Aviv, has added another title to its trophy case: semifinalist of the PokerStars Championship. The team steamrolled through the competition, making it all the way to the semifinals before finally being bested by German squad Berlin Bears.

The road to the semifinal was not always easy for Maccabi Tel Aviv. In their first match, they faced Spanish powerhouse Barcelona Team PokerStars. This would be no easy matchup for them – Barcelona is one of the best poker teams in the world. However, Maccabi Tel Aviv pulled off the upset, winning handily with a score of 9-2.

Their next matchup was against London Royals. This was another difficult opponent, as London Royals is one of Europe’s top poker clubs. However, Maccabi Tel Aviv proved too strong again, winning 8-3 and moving on to the semifinal round.

There they faced Berlin Bears. This would be their toughest opponent yet, as Berlin Bears is one of Germany’s top clubs. However, Maccabi Tel Aviv was not afraid – in fact, they were confident. They had beaten every other team that they had faced thus far handily; there was no reason to believe that they couldn’t do it again. Unfortunately for them, Berlin Bears proved to be too much and won the semifinal matchup with a score of 7-4.

While this loss was certainly disappointing for Maccabi Tel Aviv, they can still hold their heads up high knowing that they made it all the way to the semifinals of a prestigious poker tournament. They have shown that they are one of Europe’s top teams and are definitely a force to be reckoned with.
