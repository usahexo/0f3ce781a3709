#  Colorblind Individuals See Roulette Wheel Hugo In Black And White

A casino in Las Vegas is now allowing colorblind individuals to experience the thrill of playing roulette by painting the wheel black and white.

The bright colors of a roulette wheel can be overwhelming for some people, leading to an inability to make informed decisions about where to place their bets. Painting the wheel black and white makes it easier for colorblind players to see the different between the red and black slots.

The change was inspired by Hugo, a colorblind player who visited the casino and found that he couldn't tell which color slot his chip was on. "I would just put it on whatever number I felt like at the time," Hugo said. "That's not really a way to play."

The casino has already seen an increase in interest from colorblind individuals since making the change. "It's been wonderful," said one employee. "We've had people coming in from all over the world to try out this new wheel."

Some skeptics have argued that painting the wheel black and white takes away some of the excitement of playing roulette, but Hugo disagrees. "It's just as exciting," he says. "You still have to make split-second decisions about where to place your bets, and that's really what makes roulette so much fun."

#  Red, Green, Blue? To A Colorblind Individual, It's All The Same!

"What do you see?" asks the curious individual.
 to which I reply, "Red, green, and blue."
To that person, my response would be just as confusing as if I had replied with any other color. 
To me, red, green, and blue are not just colors - they're my world.

As someone who is colorblind, everyday objects and activities that others may take for granted are a mystery to me. 
I have never been able to distinguish between different colors of the rainbow. 
Instead, everything looks either beige or gray. 
While this may sound like a disadvantage to some people, I see it as simply a different way of looking at things. 

Since I was young, I have always loved puzzles and problem-solving. 
The challenge of trying to figure out what something looks like without the use of my eyes has always intrigued me. 
This mentality has helped me in other areas of life as well - for example, when I am unable to see facial expressions or body language, I need to rely on my intuition and verbal communication more. 

Despite the challenges that come with being colorblind, there are also some benefits too. 
For example, because red and green look the same to me, I often get Christmas presents that are both wrapped in green paper with a red bow - much to the surprise of my family! 
And while gaming is not as fun as it could be because I can't discern different colors on screen like others can, I have found that I am better at distinguishing shapes and contours which has helped me in strategy games like Chess and Go. 
In short, living life as a colorblind individual has helped me develop skills that other people may not have - such as problem-solving abilities and intuition.
