#  Rays Fade Out On Opening Day

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - The Rays were unable to overcome a three-run deficit in the ninth inning and lost to the Orioles on Opening Day, 5-4.

Baltimore's Brad Brach pitched a scoreless ninth inning to earn the save and spoil Tampa Bay's season opener at Tropicana Field.

Wilson Ramos put the Rays ahead 4-3 with a two-run homer off Mychal Givens in the eighth inning, but Baltimore rallied against Alex Colome in the ninth. Manny Machado tied it with an RBI single before Colome was pulled for Sergio Romo, who gave up a go-ahead sacrifice fly to Jonathan Schoop.

Rays starter Chris Archer allowed three runs and four hits over six innings. He walked two and struck out six.

The loss spoiled an impressive debut for newly acquired outfielder Carlos Gomez, who went 2 for 4 with an RBI single. Gomez was signed as a free agent in February after spending last season with Texas and Houston.

#  Late Rally Not Enough To Overcome Early Deficit, Rays Fall To White Sox

CHICAGO - A three-run rally in the ninth inning wasn't enough for the Tampa Bay Rays (65-79) as they fell to the Chicago White Sox (64-80) by a score of 4-3 on Monday night.

It was an uphill battle for the Rays from the start, as they were down 4-0 after five innings. In the top of the ninth, Brad Miller led off with a solo home run, and Mallex Smith and Adeiny Hechavarria later added RBI singles to bring the Rays within one.

However, Chicago's bullpen held on and sealed the win for the White Sox.

Despite the loss, Monday's game marked a positive turn for the Rays offense. They tallied nine hits after managing just six in their previous two games combined.

Tampa Bay will try to get back in the win column on Tuesday night, when they'll send Ryne Stanek (1-3, 5.40 ERA) to the mound against Carlos Rodon (6-10, 4.18 ERA) of the White Sox. First pitch is scheduled for 8:10 PM ET at Guaranteed Rate Field.

#  Rays Continue Disappointing Trend In Another Loss

The Tampa Bay Rays continued their disappointing trend by losing to the Toronto Blue Jays on Wednesday.

It was their third loss in a row and eighth in their past 10 games.

Their record now stands at 4-10, the worst in the American League East.

This continues a pattern of inconsistency that has characterized the Rays throughout the early part of the season.

Their offence has been unable to generate enough runs, while their pitching has been inconsistent.

There have been some bright spots, including rookie outfielder Kevin Kiermaier and starting pitcher Jake Odorizzi. But they have not been enough to overcome the team's overall deficiencies.

Manager Joe Maddon is hoping that his team can turn things around soon. "We're capable of more," he said after Wednesday's game. "We're just not doing it right now."

The Rays will look to get back on track when they face the Baltimore Orioles this weekend.

#  Maddon sticking with bullpen woes: It'll eventually work itself out

Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon said Wednesday that he is sticking with his bullpen woes and they will eventually work themselves out.

Maddon has come under fire for his decision to keep struggling reliever Pedro Strop in the closer role, despite giving up six runs in his last four appearances.

"I'm not going to change," Maddon said. "It's just a matter of time before it all clicks and we're off and running."

Maddon also reiterated his confidence in starter Tyler Chatwood, who has struggled mightily this season with a 7.02 ERA.

"He's still our guy," Maddon said. "There's no reason to panic."

#  bullpen blues continue as rays fall to toronto

In what has become a familiar story line this season, the Tampa Bay Rays bullpen imploded Sunday, surrendering six runs in the eighth inning en route to an 8-2 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays.

It was the latest in a series of blown saves for the Rays relief corps, which now has converted just six of 17 opportunities on the season.

"We continue to have some struggles," Manager Kevin Cash said. "I don't have an answer for you. I wish I did."

Cash pointed to a combination of poor pitch execution and bad luck as the primary reasons for the bullpen's struggles.

"There's been some good outings and there's been some outings where we haven't gotten the job done," he said. "But it's not from a lack of effort."

That may be true, but the bottom line is that the Rays need their bullpen to hold leads if they want to contend this season. And right now, that simply isn't happening.
