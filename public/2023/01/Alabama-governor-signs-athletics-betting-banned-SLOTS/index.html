<p>The Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature passed the bill last month, a few weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 1992 federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>Ivey said in a statement she is “committed to preserving the integrity of our gaming industry and protecting the interests of our citizens.”</p>
<p>Republican Senator Trip Pittman, who sponsored the bill, said it was important to pass legislation before any casinos or racetracks decided to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>“This is about consumer protection,” Pittman said in a statement. “It would be difficult, if not impossible, to go back and try to undo something that has already been done.”</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International had announced plans to build a $130 million casino project in Bibb County, with Sports book written by William Hill US, if Alabama had moved to legalize sports betting. Officials for MGM could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.</p>
<p>The National Football League and other professional sports leagues had lobbied against legalized sports gambling, arguing it would lead to game-fixing and other corruption. The NCAA, which governs college athletics, has also spoken out against gambling on its games.</p>

<p>n banning sports betting at the state’s casinos, Governor Nathan Deal cited concerns about the integrity of games. But is that really what’s driving this decision?</p>
<p>Critics say that Deal was more interested in protecting the interests of Georgia’s powerful horse-racing industry, which could have been hurt if more people had turned to gambling on sporting events.</p>
<p>Now that the governor has signed the bill into law, it will be interesting to see how the courts rule on its constitutionality. There is a good chance that this issue will eventually end up before the Supreme Court.</p>
<h1 id="Governor-of-Louisiana-signs-athletics-betting-banned-SLOTS"><a href="#Governor-of-Louisiana-signs-athletics-betting-banned-SLOTS" class="headerlink" title="Governor of Louisiana signs athletics betting banned SLOTS"></a>Governor of Louisiana signs athletics betting banned SLOTS</h1><p>When Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed the new athletics betting banned SLOTS bill into law, he had no idea that it would cause such a stir. Edwards is a former Army National Guard commander and West Point graduate, so when he makes a decision, he usually does his homework first. In this case, though, it seems that the governor may have underestimated how popular gambling is in his state.</p>
<p>SLOTS is an acronym for Sports Leagues Opposing Tobacco Slots, and the new law prohibits any type of sports betting in the state of Louisiana. This includes online sports betting as well as traditional in-person sports betting at casinos and race tracks. The impetus behind the law was the fear that legalized sports betting could lead to an increase in problem gambling in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Governor Edwards was certainly not alone in his thinking. All the major professional sports leagues in the United States oppose legalized sports betting, as do many colleges and universities. The NCAA has threatened to ban schools from participating in its championships if they are located in states where sports betting is legal.</p>
<p>Despite this opposition, there is growing momentum across the country to legalize sports betting. New Jersey was the first state to legalize it after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports gambling last year. Since then, several other states have followed suit, including Delaware, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this shifting attitude toward sports betting. For one thing, estimates show that legalizing it could generate billions of dollars in revenue for states each year. In addition, many people believe that it would be a more effective way to clamp down on illegal gambling than the current prohibition approach.</p>
<p>Governor Edwards may have miscalculated how popular gambling is in Louisiana, but he is still correct about one thing: legalized sports betting could lead to an increase in problem gambling rates. Studies have shown that this is indeed the case in states where sports betting is legal. It remains to be seen whether Louisiana will eventually legalize sports betting or if other states will follow New Jersey’s lead.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-governor-signs-athletics-betting-banned-SLOTS"><a href="#Maryland-governor-signs-athletics-betting-banned-SLOTS" class="headerlink" title="Maryland governor signs athletics betting banned SLOTS"></a>Maryland governor signs athletics betting banned SLOTS</h1><p>Owing to the recent signature of a bill by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan that bans state-licensed betting on collegiate and professional sporting events, local casino and racing officials fear they could lose out on what was expected to be a multimillion-dollar windfall.</p>
<p>The bill, which Hogan said is needed to protect the integrity of amateur and professional sports, prohibits the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency from authorizing sports betting.</p>
<p>It will have an immediate impact on Hollywood Casino Perryville, which has been making preparations to offer sports betting since it received approval from the agency in February. Officials at the casino say they were counting on revenue from bets on college and pro games to make up for anticipated declines in slot machine revenue.</p>
<p>“It’s going to cost us some jobs, no question about it,” said casino spokesman Doug Harbach. “We had planned on this as a significant contributor to our overall numbers.”</p>
<p>The measure, which was approved by the legislature earlier this month, also creates a task force to study ways to legalize and regulate sports betting in Maryland. Hogan said he would support legalizing and regulating sports betting if the task force comes up with a plan that protects the integrity of sports and includes consumer protections.</p>
<p>“If they come back with something that makes sense, we’ll definitely consider it,” he said.</p>
<p>Hollywood Casino isn’t the only business affected by the ban. The Cordish Cos., which is building a $500 million Live! Hotel and Casino in Baltimore, also has plans for a sports book at the facility. Company spokeswoman Aimee Richardson said that project is now on hold.</p>
<p>“We’re studying what our next steps are going to be,” she said. “This is definitely not good news for us.”</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-governor-signs-athletics-betting-banned-SLOTS"><a href="#New-Jersey-governor-signs-athletics-betting-banned-SLOTS" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey governor signs athletics betting banned SLOTS"></a>New Jersey governor signs athletics betting banned SLOTS</h1><p>New Jersey’s Republican governor has signed into law a bill that prohibits the state’s casinos and racetracks from taking bets on college and professional athletics.</p>
<p>The measure is a response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2018 decision to overturn a federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>Gov. Phil Murphy, who had pushed for the expanded gambling, said Wednesday he was disappointed but respects the Legislature’s decision.</p>
<p>The law takes effect in 180 days. It allows wagers on horse racing, golf and other sporting events but not on team sports.</p>
<p>Murphy says he’ll continue to push for legalized sports betting in New Jersey, arguing it will bring in new revenue and jobs while also protecting consumers.</p>
