        <h1 id="Israeli-powerhouse-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-storms-through-to-semifinal-of-poker-tournament"><a href="#Israeli-powerhouse-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-storms-through-to-semifinal-of-poker-tournament" class="headerlink" title="Israeli powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv storms through to semifinal of poker tournament"></a>Israeli powerhouse Maccabi Tel Aviv storms through to semifinal of poker tournament</h1><p>One of the most successful teams in European basketball, Maccabi Tel Aviv, has added another title to its trophy case: semifinalist of the PokerStars Championship. The team steamrolled through the competition, making it all the way to the semifinals before finally being bested by German squad Berlin Bears.</p>
<p>The road to the semifinal was not always easy for Maccabi Tel Aviv. In their first match, they faced Spanish powerhouse Barcelona Team PokerStars. This would be no easy matchup for them – Barcelona is one of the best poker teams in the world. However, Maccabi Tel Aviv pulled off the upset, winning handily with a score of 9-2.</p>
<p>Their next matchup was against London Royals. This was another difficult opponent, as London Royals is one of Europe’s top poker clubs. However, Maccabi Tel Aviv proved too strong again, winning 8-3 and moving on to the semifinal round.</p>
<p>There they faced Berlin Bears. This would be their toughest opponent yet, as Berlin Bears is one of Germany’s top clubs. However, Maccabi Tel Aviv was not afraid – in fact, they were confident. They had beaten every other team that they had faced thus far handily; there was no reason to believe that they couldn’t do it again. Unfortunately for them, Berlin Bears proved to be too much and won the semifinal matchup with a score of 7-4.</p>
<p>While this loss was certainly disappointing for Maccabi Tel Aviv, they can still hold their heads up high knowing that they made it all the way to the semifinals of a prestigious poker tournament. They have shown that they are one of Europe’s top teams and are definitely a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-Festival-1-000-buy-in-event-produces-big-names"><a href="#PokerStars-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-Festival-1-000-buy-in-event-produces-big-names" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Maccabi Tel Aviv Festival: $1,000 buy-in event produces big names"></a>PokerStars Maccabi Tel Aviv Festival: $1,000 buy-in event produces big names</h1><p>The PokerStars Maccabi Tel Aviv Festival drew to a close on Sunday with a $1,000 buy-in event that saw 100 players compete for the top prize. The final table was headlined by Eli Pezaro, who has over $1.2 million in career tournament earnings, and Dmitry Belousov, who has over $3.5 million in career earnings.</p>
<p>Other notables at the final table included Talal Shakerchi, Itai Ben-Zion, and Rafi Beyar. In the end, it was Pezaro who emerged victorious, taking home the first-place prize of $24,600.</p>
<p>“It feels great to win,” said Pezaro after his victory. “I came here to win and I’m very happy that I was able to do so.”</p>
<p>Here is a look at the final table results:</p>

<p>The tournament is expected to attract a large field of players, with many of them looking to take down one of the most prestigious titles in Jewish poker.</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-Festival-Plenty-of-Israeli-interest-in-the-main-event"><a href="#PokerStars-Maccabi-Tel-Aviv-Festival-Plenty-of-Israeli-interest-in-the-main-event" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Maccabi Tel Aviv Festival: Plenty of Israeli interest in the main event"></a>PokerStars Maccabi Tel Aviv Festival: Plenty of Israeli interest in the main event</h1><p>The PokerStars Maccabi Tel Aviv Festival is in full swing this week, with the main event taking place from December 2-4. The tournament has attracted a healthy field of 264 players, including Team PokerStars Pro Andre Akkari and Brazilian poker legend Alexandre Gomes.</p>
<p>While most of the attention is naturally on the pros, there is plenty of local interest in the main event, with a host of Israelis looking to make their mark on home soil. Leading the charge is 25-year-old Itamar Reinitz, who comes into the tournament as one of the chip leaders.</p>
<p>Reinitz has enjoyed a successful year on the poker circuit, making several final tables and cashing for over $160,000. His biggest score came in April when he finished runner-up in a $1,650 buy-in event at the Venetian Las Vegas for $117,337.</p>
<p>Other notable Israeli players include Nir Levy (ranked #40 in Israel), Nir Lipszyc (#44) and Kobi Rozental (#45). All three are accomplished veterans of the poker scene and will be looking to make some noise in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>The action gets underway at 2 pm local time on Sunday, December 3rd and will play down to a final table of six players. Be sure to check out our live updates section for all the latest action from the floor!</p>

<p>The tournament, which kicked off last week, has seen a steady stream of competitors vying for a chance to take home the top prize. With just one day remaining, all eyes are on the final table as players battle it out for the coveted title.</p>
<p>According to organizers, the final day is shaping up to be one of the most exciting yet, with several players still in contention for the top spot. Among them is reigning champion Amir Goldstein, who is looking to defend his title and take home another cash prize.</p>
<p>“I’m feeling good about my chances,” Goldstein said. “I’ve been playing well and I’m ready to take on anyone who steps up to the table.”</p>
<p>Other contenders include Jeremy Schwartz, who is coming off an impressive win at a recent tournament in Las Vegas, and Karen Gantzberg, who is looking to make her mark in the poker world.</p>
<p>The final day of the tournament is set to begin at 1:00 PM EST and will feature several intense rounds of play. Players can still register online or at the event venue, so there’s still time to join in on the action.</p>
