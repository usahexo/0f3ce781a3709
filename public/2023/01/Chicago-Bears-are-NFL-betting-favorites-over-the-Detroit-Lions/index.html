        <h1 id="Chicago-Bears-are-NFL-betting-favorites-over-the-Detroit-Lions"><a href="#Chicago-Bears-are-NFL-betting-favorites-over-the-Detroit-Lions" class="headerlink" title="Chicago Bears are NFL betting favorites over the Detroit Lions"></a>Chicago Bears are NFL betting favorites over the Detroit Lions</h1><p>It doesn’t come as much of a surprise that the Chicago Bears are favored to win over the Detroit Lions in their Week 4 matchup. The Bears have looked strong out of the gate, with quarterback Mitchell Trubisky looking like he could be a star in the making.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Detroit has had a tough start to the season, losing their first three games. The Lions have looked particularly bad offensively, averaging just 14 points per game. This is likely why they are currently sizeable underdogs against Chicago.</p>
<p>The Bears are expected to win this game by six points, giving them a 58% chance of victory according to odds Vegas Insider. If you’re thinking about placing a bet on this game, the Bears would be a good option.</p>
<h1 id="Jay-Cutler-is-listed-as-125-favorite-to-start-at-QB-for-Chicago-Bears"><a href="#Jay-Cutler-is-listed-as-125-favorite-to-start-at-QB-for-Chicago-Bears" class="headerlink" title="Jay Cutler is listed as -125 favorite to start at QB for Chicago Bears"></a>Jay Cutler is listed as -125 favorite to start at QB for Chicago Bears</h1><p>The Bears open up the 2017 NFL season on Sunday, September 10th against the Atlanta Falcons. Chicago faithful have been buzzing about the potential of the team this year and with good reason. The Bears have made some nice additions in the off-season, including quarterback Mike Glennon and wide receiver Markus Wheaton.</p>
<p>One question that has yet to be answered is who will start at quarterback for Chicago. Jay Cutler, who has been with the Bears since 2009, is currently listed as a -125 favorite to be the starter. However, Cutler has not played well in recent years and there is a chance that he could be benched in favor of Glennon.</p>
<p>Glennon was signed by the Bears this past March after spending three seasons with the Buccaneers. He has thrown for 4,100 yards and 29 touchdowns in his career. Glennon is not considered to be a superstar quarterback but he does have some upside and should be an improvement over Cutler.</p>
<p>The Bears also have third-string quarterback Connor Shaw on their roster. Shaw was signed as an undrafted free agent in 2014 and has spent time with both the Browns and 49ers. He has yet to play in an NFL game.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see who starts at quarterback for the Bears on Sunday. If Cutler falters early on, there is a good chance that he will be replaced by Glennon. The Bears are definitely a team to watch this year!</p>
<h1 id="Chicago-Bears-looking-to-bounce-back-after-two-consecutive-losses"><a href="#Chicago-Bears-looking-to-bounce-back-after-two-consecutive-losses" class="headerlink" title="Chicago Bears looking to bounce back after two consecutive losses"></a>Chicago Bears looking to bounce back after two consecutive losses</h1><p>The Chicago Bears were looking to start the season strong, but have since fallen on hard times with back-to-back losses. They will now look to bounce back as they take on the Detroit Lions this Sunday.</p>
<p>One of the big reasons for the Bears’ struggles has been their inability to run the ball effectively. In their two losses, they’ve only managed to gain a combined total of 192 yards on the ground. Jordan Howard has been particularly ineffective, averaging just 2.7 yards per carry.</p>
<p>If the Bears hope to get back in the win column this week, they’ll need to get their running game going. The Lions defense has been vulnerable against the run this year, giving up an average of 121 yards per game.</p>
<p>Another key for Chicago will be taking care of the ball. They’ve turned it over six times in their last two games, which has led to a number of easy points for their opponents. If they can limit their turnovers, they should be able to come away with a victory.</p>
<p>The Lions have had their own share of struggles this season, and currently sit at 3-4 overall. A win would go a long way in helping them stay in contention for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>This should be an exciting matchup between two teams looking to get back on track. Be sure to tune in on Sunday to see which one comes out on top!</p>
<h1 id="Bears-vs-Lions-Who-has-the-edge-in-the-betting-line"><a href="#Bears-vs-Lions-Who-has-the-edge-in-the-betting-line" class="headerlink" title="Bears vs Lions: Who has the edge in the betting line?"></a>Bears vs Lions: Who has the edge in the betting line?</h1><p>The Bears and the Lions have one of the NFL’s most storied rivalries, and there is always a lot on the line when they meet.</p>
<p>The Bears come into this game as 3-point favorites, but who really has the edge? Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>Offense</p>
<p>The Lions have been struggling offensively lately. They rank last in the league in yards per game, and 31st in points per game.</p>
<p>Matthew Stafford has not been playing well, and the team’s running game has been nonexistent. The Bears should be able to shut them down easily.</p>
<p>Defense</p>
<p>The Bears’ defense has been surprisingly bad this year. They rank 30th in yards allowed per game and 26th in points allowed per game.</p>
<p>However, they are facing a Lions offense that is arguably one of the worst in the league. If Chicago’s defense can’t stop Detroit, then they are in trouble.</p>
<p>Special Teams</p>
<p>Both teams have been mediocre on special teams this year. The Bears have scored a touchdown on punt return, while the Lions have kicked two field goals on punt returns. Neither team has had much success returning kicks or punts.</p>
<h1 id="Chicago-Bears-set-as-3-point-favorites-against-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers"><a href="#Chicago-Bears-set-as-3-point-favorites-against-Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers" class="headerlink" title="Chicago Bears set as 3-point favorites against Tampa Bay Buccaneers"></a>Chicago Bears set as 3-point favorites against Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h1><p>The Chicago Bears will be looking to build off their Week 1 win as they take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bears are set as 3-point favorites against the Bucs, according to Vegas Insider.</p>
<p>Chicago had a strong performance in their season opener, defeating the Green Bay Packers 24-23. Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky played well in his first NFL start, throwing for two touchdowns and 245 yards. The Bears’ defense also played well, holding the Packers to just 23 points.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay is coming off a 48-40 loss to the New Orleans Saints. Buccaneers quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick had a good game, throwing for 417 yards and four touchdowns. However, the Buccaneers defense was unable to stop the Saints, who scored 48 points.</p>
<p>The Bears should be able to win this game against the Buccaneers. Trubisky looked good in Week 1 and the Bears’ defense is one of the best in the NFL. The Bucs are coming off a high-scoring loss and may not be able to keep up with the Bears’ offense.</p>
