It was their fourth win in a row and gives them some momentum as they head into a tough stretch of their schedule.</p>
<p>Cole Hamels got the start and pitched well, striking out nine batters over six innings while only allowing two runs. His performance was crucial, as the Rangers’ bullpen had been taxed recently.</p>
<p>Carlos Gomez led the offense with three hits, including two doubles, and two RBIs. He has been on a hot streak lately, and it is critical for the Rangers that he continues to produce.</p>
<p>The Rangers will now head to Boston for a three-game series against the Red Sox. It will be a tough test for them, but they appear to be playing well heading into it.</p>
<h1 id="Mazara-hits-2-HRs-as-Rangers-top-Astros"><a href="#Mazara-hits-2-HRs-as-Rangers-top-Astros" class="headerlink" title="Mazara hits 2 HRs as Rangers top Astros"></a>Mazara hits 2 HRs as Rangers top Astros</h1><p>The Texas Rangers beat the Houston Astros 7-6 on Sunday, with Mazara hitting two home runs.</p>
<p>Mazara’s first homer came in the second inning, and gave the Rangers a 3-1 lead. His second homer came in the fifth inning, and gave the Rangers a 6-5 lead.</p>
<p>“I was just trying to put a good swing on it,” Mazara said of his homers. “I got some pitches I could handle and I didn’t miss them.”</p>
<p>The Rangers bullpen also played a role in Sunday’s win. José Leclerc got the final four outs for his fourth save of the season.</p>
<p>“It was good that we were able to get some runs late and José was able to close it out,” Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.</p>
<p>The Rangers now head to Seattle for a three-game series against the Mariners.</p>
<h1 id="Odor-homers-as-Rangers-beat-Astros-for-6th-time-in-row"><a href="#Odor-homers-as-Rangers-beat-Astros-for-6th-time-in-row" class="headerlink" title="Odor homers as Rangers beat Astros for 6th time in row"></a>Odor homers as Rangers beat Astros for 6th time in row</h1><p>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) Shin-Soo Choo homered and Odor had four hits as the Rangers beat the Astros 8-2 on Wednesday night for their sixth straight victory.</p>
<p>Choo led off the second inning with his ninth homer, a 417-foot drive to center field off Collin McHugh (3-4). Mitch Moreland followed with a double and scored on Rougned Odor’s two-out single.</p>
<p>In the fourth, Choo drew a leadoff walk from McHugh and scored on Jonathan Lucroy’s double. Odor singled and later scored on a wild pitch to make it 4-0.</p>
<p>Odor hit his 10th homer in the seventh inning, a solo shot off Luke Gregerson. Elvis Andrus added an RBI single in the eighth.</p>
<p>Martin Perez (3-3) allowed two runs over six innings. He gave up six hits, struck out five and walked one.</p>
<p>McHugh allowed four runs in four innings. He surrendered six hits, struck out three and walked one.</p>
<h1 id="Hamels-pitches-Rangers-past-Astros"><a href="#Hamels-pitches-Rangers-past-Astros" class="headerlink" title="Hamels pitches Rangers past Astros"></a>Hamels pitches Rangers past Astros</h1><p>HOUSTON (AP) - Cole Hamels pitched six innings for his first victory in more than a month and Nomar Mazara and Rougned Odor homered to lead the Texas Rangers past the Houston Astros 4-1 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Hamels (5-9), who had not won since June 6, surrendered one run and four hits with six strikeouts to snap a seven-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Mazara hit his 16th homer of the season in the fourth inning to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead. Odor connected on his 14th homer with two outs in the seventh.</p>
<p>Houston’s Lance McCullers (10-4) yielded four runs and seven hits with eight strikeouts in six innings. He has given up 11 homers in his last eight starts.</p>
<p>McCullers threw a wild pitch that allowed Ryan Rua to score from third base to make it 3-1 in the sixth inning. The Rangers added an insurance run on a sacrifice fly by Elvis Andrus.</p>
<p>The Astros scored their only run on an RBI single by Evan Gattis in the seventh inning.</p>
<h1 id="Beltre-powers-Rangers-past-Astros"><a href="#Beltre-powers-Rangers-past-Astros" class="headerlink" title="Beltre powers Rangers past Astros"></a>Beltre powers Rangers past Astros</h1><p>The Texas Rangers have been on a tear as of late, and that was on display Wednesday night against the Houston Astros. Adrian Beltre led the way offensively, going 3-4 with two homers and four RBIs.</p>
<p>The Rangers got on the board early thanks to a Beltre homer in the first inning. He added another solo homer in the fourth inning, and then drove in two runs with a single in the sixth inning. His big night helped propel the Rangers to an 8-3 victory.</p>
<p>The win moves the Rangers into first place in the American League West, one game ahead of the Astros. They will look to stay ahead of their division rivals with another win on Thursday night.</p>
